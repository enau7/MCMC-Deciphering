I would like to have a coding oriented project, which may be the application for the material we learned, because it would be more practical and a good integration of theory and application. Also I love solve a problem on my own. I prefer a written report because a presentation may cause a time conflict and require much work of coordination. Rather, a written report would be more flexible, which is good during the final week.
