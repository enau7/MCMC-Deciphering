I dont prefer a coding oriented project. I prefer the project can be based on the knowledge learned in this class. I would rather read new material and summarize it than solve a problem on my own. Besides, the format of the project I prefer to write a report instead of a presentation. For this class, I hope to explain more example questions in detail in the lecture to facilitate the understanding and application of concepts and theories, and questions in quiz are also needed to be explained.
