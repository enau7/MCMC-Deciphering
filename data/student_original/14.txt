Ive enjoyed seeing the theory that were learning getting tied back to the example of Google PageRank. For the rest of the course, it would be great to see examples like this showing the application of the theory. For the project, personally I would enjoy a more coding oriented project. Because of this, I feel like trying to solve a problem would fit into the project. I would prefer a written reportmaybe it could be in the form of a powerpoint, with a supplemental short report.
