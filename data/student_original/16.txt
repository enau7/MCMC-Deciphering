I am not a coding person so I prefer the project to be more fun and cover some new material or theory. I do like derivation if we are able to get hints from the TAs and the professor.

I dont like reading. Watching videos will be perfectly fine.

I think a written report is fine as long as it does not have to be too long. Presentation is also fine.

I am pretty lost in the course so far. I wonder if we can have some 11 office hours with TAs and the professor. Also maybe provide some guidance in studying on our own.
