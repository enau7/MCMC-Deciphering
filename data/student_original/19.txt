I would prefer to have a more coding oriented project as it allows for students to bulk up their resumes. In my opinion, this would be harder to implement if we were sticking with group projects since code can get quite unique and complicated to understand for other group members who didnt write the code and different students may have a better understanding of different languages. If the final project is more coding oriented, I think it would be best to try and solve a problem or apply what we already learned to a problem. Lastly, I personally prefer a report since I cannot stand public speaking. Moreover, presenting or discussing a report with a recruiter or employer looks a lot more formal than talking about google slides in my opinion.
