To be completely honest, I am not very good at coding and my homework group has done the majority of the coding for me. I would be interested in learning python as I am currently using it for another class as well, but do not feel very confident in my abilities and worry that a super coding-heavy project would be very difficult for me. I have enjoyed the theory of this class greatly and would prefer to learn more about theory rather than application. The class gets very interesting when we discuss real-world examples, mainly the Google PageRank stuff. It makes it so much easier to understand and I find it much more valuable than doing computations without conceptualization. I vote that we continue learning theory and summarizing. As for a final project, I would also prefer a written report. Finals tend to get very stressful for me and there is a lot of beauty in writing something out, turning it in, and not having to deal with test/presentation anxiety.

I have greatly enjoyed this course so far and I am looking forward to continuing it. Thank you so much for your hard work.
