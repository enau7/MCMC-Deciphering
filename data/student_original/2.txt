Ive enjoyed the format of this class so far. The pacing has been just right and, at least currently, I feel like I really understand the material.



With regards to the final project, I would much prefer to actually solve a problem, whether it be through implementing code or just doing a lot of math, instead of just reading something and talking about what I learned. Id also rather do a written report over a presentation, since its easier for me to explain mathtechnical details via writing.
