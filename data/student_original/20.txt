Although the content itself is challenging, I have enjoyed this course so far. I think lectures are really interesting and I like how things are applied to real world examples. I also enjoy working with my HW group and putting our minds together. 

For the final project, I think a presentation on a problem or theory would be interesting. I think it would also be cool to apply things we’ve learned in class to a real world example for our own projects. Overall, this course is challenging but I enjoy it.
