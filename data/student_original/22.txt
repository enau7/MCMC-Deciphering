The project could be about explaining an application and put examples with coding results.

Learning new material sounds interesting because we can research how an application is useful for a field of study of our reference. We can also show examples.

I strongly prefer a written report because it is time efficient and not as complicated to set up as a presentation. A written report can be accessed multiple times by the author and will definitely include more information. A long presentation does not have this advantage since the audience will most likely not pay attention to all details in one sitting. To understand a section, it is easier to read it multiple times.
