For the project I would prefer to cover a new application. I think that a coding oriented project would hinder my ability to actually learn the concept and focus on just figuring out how to put it into code. My weakness is definitely coding but I dont think a project worth 15 is where I could practice and learn efficiently.

I would prefer to read new material and summarize it to learn a more topics in Stochastic Processes.

I would prefer a written report so that we can refine the details of our projects easily as well as practicing LaTeX formatting. this is my first time using it It would avoid having nervous hiccups affecting our grade while presenting. I also would not mind a pretaped presentation but written presentation would be most preferred
