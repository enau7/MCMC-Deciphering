Coding oriented would be most interesting. The focus on the applicability of the theory has helped me better understand it, as with the google page rank example.

I think that proposing a new problem to solve and then providing the theory and materials necessary to solve the problem would be cool. Then when reading through the materials, you can examine how this theory might apply to the real world situation, or how to use it to build an effective algorithm. This emphasizes critical thinking skills rather than memorization or regurgitation.
