I would prefer a more coding oriented project where we can utilize coding languages like R and Python. I would prefer to try to solve a problem on my own. I would prefer to have a written report with graphs and analysis. A suggestion that I have for the class is to explain concepts more in detail in lecture. Often times, I felt like some parts are skimmed through. Even though some materials were taught in 160A, it would be nice to reinforce on those concepts as a class.
