I would prefer a mix of both coding and application of new theory but I dont mind coding. I also dont really care about sumarizing new material or solving my own, but I think it would be fun to interpret and try to explain new material. The only one I feel strongly about is the last option, I would prefer a pre taped presentation or a written report. I would also prefer if the final project was in the same homework group setting we have been in up until now.
