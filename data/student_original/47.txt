Some thoughts on the course so far

 Quiz 1 was very fair in difficulty i think, not entirely free but was not crazy difficult, hope future quizzes can be the same

 Prefer to read new material, I really like the examples given in class and they transfer to the homework pretty well

 Homework seems a little difficult  timeconsuming at times

 Prefer more theory although some coding would be cool as well

 Prefer project be on an application of Stochastic processes, sort of like the ones covered in class
