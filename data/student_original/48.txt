I would prefer a more application based project, the coding on hw1 was bit hard, I was unable to solve it myself but eventually after working with my teammates we solved it together. So far Im really enjoying the applications of the concepts learned in class, including the movie references! its a nice change because my previous statistics courses were heavily theory based. As of now I would also prefer reading new material and making sense of it, as this seems to be helpful for me to digest the information in class. Lastly, I would prefer a written report, though since I am interested in artvisuals, if allowed I may incorporate a creative aspect to the project report.
