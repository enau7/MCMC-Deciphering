I really enjoy the course so far and find the material challenging but also fascinating. I would like a coding oriented project but I do not have a lot of experience and may struggle. I think that solving a new problem or creating a simulation would be really cool. Lastly, I would like to do a recorded presentation or a write up rather than an in person presentation.
