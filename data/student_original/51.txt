To be completely honest, I am not very good at coding and my homework group has done the majority of the coding for me. I would be interested in learning python as I am currently using it for another class as well, but do not feel very confident in my abilities and worry that a super codingheavy project would be very difficult for me. I have enjoyed the theory of this class greatly and would prefer to learn more about theory rather than application. The class gets very interesting when we discuss realworld examples, mainly the Google PageRank stuff. It makes it so much easier to understand and I find it much more valuable than doing computations without conceptualization. I vote that we continue learning theory and summarizing. As for a final project, I would also prefer a written report. Finals tend to get very stressful for me and there is a lot of beauty in writing something out, turning it in, and not having to deal with testpresentation anxiety.

I have greatly enjoyed this course so far and I am looking forward to continuing it. Thank you so much for your hard work.
