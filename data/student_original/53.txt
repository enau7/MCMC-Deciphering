 As Im striving to work in the tech industry, more codingoriented projects would help sharpen my Python skills. I would also like to see shorter and easier coding questions outside of boss mode in homework.

 I like to solve problems on my own. Im more of a handson person than a reader.

 I dont mind whether the report is going to be written or presented. However, if the presentation is the case, then I would prefer it to be in person.

 I like how the Google search analogy helped me understand the mathematical material better. I would like more reallife application analogies in the future.
