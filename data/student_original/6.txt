I think the course is going well so far. I like how the examples in class can usually be drawn out in a simple manner so we can more easily understand them, and then apply them to more complex topics. I would prefer learning more about a new theory or learning how something has other applications. I would be okay with reading and summarizing material, or reading material and using it to solve the problem. I would like to write a written report instead of doing a presentation, but honestly either would be fine with me. This class is really interesting so far, and I love how we talk about how these processes are used in everyday life, like with the Google example.
